# GenAI Tools
This repository is a collection of tools based on generative AI models that I built for personal use. The `tools` directory contains all the tools in individual directories. Each of the tool directories contains a `README.md` file that provides detailed information about the motivation, functionality, and usage of the tool.

## AI Disclaimer
The development of these tools involved usage of several AI-coding assistants including GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex.
